# Time-Series-Analysis-for-Global-Temperature-Predictions-using-ML

The goal is to derive a robust understanding of long-term climate trends, considering the impact of historical factors on temperature variations. Through Bayesian regression, I aim to provide insights into the global climate dynamics, addressing concerns and contributing to a nuanced perspective on climate changeâ€”a topic of significant societal and environmental importance.

Data Description:

Berkeley Earth (2023). "Climate Change: Earth Surface Temperature Data". Kaggle. [Online]. 
Available: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data/data. Accessed: December 2023.

The dataset consists of around 550,000 observations from various countries. To study the effects of environmental factors or industrialization in detail, we focused on the data from the United States. The variables present in the dataset are as follows:

dt - starts in 1750 for average land temperature
AverageTemperature - average land temperature in celsius
AverageTemperatureUncertainty - the 95% confidence interval around the average

**The dataset can be found in the repository.**
